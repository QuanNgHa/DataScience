### Conver Python List to Numpy Array:


```Python
# Import numpy as np
import numpy as np

# Store pop as a numpy array: np_pop <= Conver pop List to Numpy Array
np_pop = np.array(pop)

# Double np_pop: Double the values in np_pop by assigning np_pop * 2 to np_pop again. 
# Because np_pop is a Numpy array, each array element will be doubled.
np_pop = np_pop*2
```
